.SH NAME
roffit \- convert nroff to HTML
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B roffit [options] < inputfile > outputfile
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B roffit
converts the \fIinputfile\fP to \fIoutputfile\fP. The \fIinputfile\fP must be
an nroff formatted man page, and the \fIoutputfile\fP will be an HTML
document.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \-\-bare
The output HTML will not include any HTML, HEAD or BODY tags. Also not that
when this is selected, there will be no inlined CSS but you will have to
define the necessary classes yourself.
.IP \-\-version
Display version number and exit
.IP \-\-mandir=<dir>
Set a directory in which \fIroffit\fP will check for other man pages (in nroff
[name].[num] format) that this one refers to. If found, a <a href> link will
be made to that page with a html extension instead of the number. The file
name in the generated link will be prefixed by the dir given with
\fI\-\-hrefdir\fP.

This works for references specified as \fImanpage(3)\fP (within the emhpasis
foformatting) and in a plain \.BR section (often used in the SEE ALSO
section).
.IP \-\-hrefdir=<dir>
Specify a directory to prefix generated href links created with the \-\-mandir
option. This defaults to ".".
.IP \-\-preserve-case
When used, this makes roffit preserve the case in SH (section header) in the
output instead of uppercasing the first letter and doing the rest lowercase.
The case changing was introduced in roffit 0.13.
.SH "CSS CLASSES"
.IP h2.nroffsh
The nroff ".SH" section. These are normally the "headlines" before each sub
section within the man page.
.IP p.nroffip
The nroff ".IP" section. These are normally the bullet kind used to list each
option out of several in a list. Usually followed by a \fIp.level0\fP
containining the descriptive text.
.IP p.level0
Normal text at the first level. Normally not indented.
.IP p.level1
Text at next logical indent level. Normally indented one level right.
.IP p.level2
