.SH NAME
testpage \- test input nroff man page for roffit testing
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B roffit
[\fI\,options\/\fR] < inputfile > outputfile
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B roffit
converts the \fIinputfile\fP to \fIoutputfile\fP. The \fIinputfile\fP must be
an nroff formatted man page, and the \fIoutputfile\fP will be an HTML
document.

(RFC 959) is FTP

but ARFC 959 is a fake

RFC3986 is URI syntax

Also, we must support \fIstyle staring on one line
and ending on another
that may\fP be multiple lines off.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--bare"
The output HTML will not include any HTML, HEAD or BODY tags. Also not that
when this is selected, there will be no inlined CSS but you will have to
define the necessary classes yourself.
.IP "--mumbo"
Display version number and exit. Also see \fB--jumbo\fP. Word in bold.
.IP "--jumbo"
Cool option. See \fI--mumbo\fP. Word in italic.
.IP \-\-mandir=<dir>
Set a directory in which \fIroffit\fP will check for other man pages (in nroff
[name].[num] format) that this one refers to. If found, a <a href> link will
be made to that page with a html extension instead of the number. The file
name in the generated link will be prefixed by the dir given with
\fI\-\-hrefdir\fP.

This works for references specified as \fImanpage(3)\fP (within the emhpasis
foformatting) and in a plain \.BR section (often used in the SEE ALSO
section).
.IP \-\-hrefdir=<dir>
Specify a directory to prefix generated href links created with the \-\-mandir
option. This defaults to ".".

section within the man page.
